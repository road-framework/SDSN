	- Message transformations
	- Rule evaluations

Scenario 2: (Simple)
-----------------------------------------
- Message driven
- Simple interactions
- Based on USDL as a service scenario.
- Demonstrate all capabilities except support for business processes. 

Scenario 3: 
-----------------------------------------
REMOVED. 

Scenario 4: (Simple, Set up for bench test)
-----------------------------------------

- Demonstrates the full capabilities of the ROAD framework including ,
	- Support for business processes
	- Behavior modelling
	- Message transformations
	- Rule evaluations
	
Scenario 5: (Simple)

Notes for sample writers:
-----------------------------------------
1. Add all your sample composites to here.
2. If you have clients (Client players) code, please place them inside client/[clientName]
3. If you have sample services (Service players), please place them inside players/[services*, e.g., MyService.Java]
